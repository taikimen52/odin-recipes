The Odin project Foundations Course Project : Recipes

2025.8.26
In the TOP foundation curriculum, I've been studied Linux commands, Git, and HTML. 
Then now I try to make own Webpags with recipes as the theme.
In this project, I would like to learn more about HTML and Git commands, and try using them in a practical setting.
